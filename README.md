This system is for playing multiple World of Darkness 5th edition systems on the Foundry Virtual Tabletop System.

Licensed WoD 5e materials will NOT be provided, as this is a system provided for public use for free.  I have made every effort to observe the Dark Pack guidelines as posted at https://www.worldofdarkness.com/dark-pack. 

There is integration with Dice So Nice! 
To roll regular Vampire dice, roll `1dv`. To roll Hunger dice, roll `1dg`. Replace the 1s with however many dice you want to roll for each type.
To roll regular Hunter dice, roll `1dh`. To roll Desperation dice, roll `1ds`. Replace the 1s with however many dice you want to roll for each type.

## Feedback

Bugs reported as issues to this repository are greatly appreciated.

Please reach out to me at MrDionysus#9673 on Discord with issues, feature requests, etc.

The Hunter-specific translations were provided by Google Translate, and I'm sure many of them are wrong, especially "Edges" and "Drive".  If you can help translate/localize for a particular language, please let me know!

Please check the issues list before suggesting new features. :smiley:

## Todo
* Add Hunter-specific dice rolls to the dice roller

* Add attributes and rolls to Edges - Not feasible without reworking Edges to be items.  For now, create a rollable perk named after the roll you want to save
* Remove attributes tab and rolls from Perks  - Left as a workaround for the Edge rolls above


## Credits

All the work for the Vampire 5th edition content was initially performed by weinerdolphin#3175.  At this point I've just added Hunter sheets and released this project as a comprehensive 5e module instead of a Vampire-Specific module.
