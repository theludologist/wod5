# How to contribute to Foundry-V5

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Rayji96/foundry-V5/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Rayji96/foundry-V5/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description and label it as bug** and as much relevant information as possible. **Steps to reproduce or a screenshot is a must!**

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Super-Linter is setup to ensure clean code. PRs will not be accepted until Super-Linter passes on the PR.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue labelled as an enhancement. I'll try to reply as quickly as possible to discuss whether it fits in Foundry-V5 or better lives as a FoundryVTT module.
